Try it here: https://gageracer.github.io/myStuff/

This is a simple Web App Project for me to learn and hopefully share to anyone interested in Svelte! Whole purpose of the app is to keep track of stuff you have at home/work or wherever so when you forgot if you have milk at home or not you can check it!

Stuff I want to add are:

- PWA compatibility :heavy_check_mark:
- Add quantity for some items like Eggs,sock pairs etc.
- Low quantity threshold setting for certain items.
- Alert system for periodicly updating items or changing/removing/cleanig.

Please give me feedback on anything to make me a better Svelter, Thanks!

# svelte app

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Deploying to the web

### With [now](https://zeit.co/now)

Install `now` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g now
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
cd public
now
```

As an alternative, use the [Now desktop client](https://zeit.co/download) and simply drag the unzipped project folder to the taskbar icon.

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g surge
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
npm run build
surge public
```
